[00:47:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <Om3gaNut> the problem is you put the source block on a elevation
[00:47:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Om3gaNut> so the water flows down
[00:47:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <Om3gaNut> wheres ya buckets
[00:47:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <J9> er
[00:48:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <Om3gaNut> got more than one?
